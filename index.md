### About me

```markdown

I currently have a Bsc Degree 
in Medical Biotechnology 
from the School of Health of Polytechnic 
Institute of Porto, also enrolled in the 
first year of the Master's Degree in 
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology 
at Faculty of Science - Oporto's University 
and I'm currently studying Bioinformatics 
(Master's Degree) in Lund University.

My Bachelor's thesis was based
on the Computational Chemistry area,
concretely by searching for new drug 
candidates with antibiofilm activity
against bacteria using Molecular Docking 
and Virtual Screening.

I consider having extraordinary 
experiences in interpersonal and 
international relations due
to previous projects.
