### About me

```markdown

I currently have a Bsc Degree in Medical Biotechnology 
from the School of Health of Polytechnic Institute of Porto, 
also enrolled in the first year of the Master's Degree in 
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Faculty of Science 
- Oporto's University and I'm currently studying Bioinformatics (Master's Degree) in Lund University.

My Bachelor's thesis was based on the Computational Chemistry area,
concretely by searching for new drug candidates with antibiofilm activity
against bacteria using Molecular Docking and Virtual Screening.
I consider having extraordinary experiences in interpersonal and 
international relations due to previous projects.
